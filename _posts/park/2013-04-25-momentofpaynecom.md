It derives from the pre 7th century personal name "Pagen", itself from the word "paien" and the earlier Latin "paganus". The original meaning was a villager or rustic, and later a heathen! <em>Source:Â <a href="http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Payne#ixzz2Rie3C3IV">http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Payne#ixzz2Rie3C3IV</a></em></p>
