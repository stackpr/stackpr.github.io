Over time, this becomes a major problem for backups since new data is written into random empty space in the database. That creates a situation where a few new emails can cause the entire database to require a backup. Performing an "offline backup" automatically compresses the database, but IÂ found a lack of documentation on how it was performed. Once the commands are identified, it is actually quite simple. The directories and database names are standard for a basic install on Windows SBS 2003.</p>
<p>First, select "<strong>Dismount Store</strong>" on the mailbox store.</p>
<p>Then, open a <strong>command prompt</strong> and run the following:</p>
<pre>
C:\Program Files\Support Tools&gt;<strong>cd C:\Program Files\Exchsrvr\MDBDATA</strong>
C:\Program Files\Exchsrvr\MDBDATA&gt;<strong>..\bin\eseutil.exe /d priv1.edb</strong>

Initiating DEFRAGMENTATION mode...
            Database: priv1.edb
      Streaming File: priv1.STM
      Temp. Database: TEMPDFRG7700.EDB
Temp. Streaming File: TEMPDFRG7700.STM
                  Defragmentation Status (% complete)
          0    10   20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90  100
          |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
          ...................................................
Moving 'TEMPDFRG7700.EDB' to 'priv1.edb'... DONE!
Moving 'TEMPDFRG7700.STM' to 'priv1.stm'... DONE!
Note:
  It is recommended that you immediately perform a full backup
  of this database. If you restore a backup made before the
  defragmentation, the database will be rolled back to the state
  it was in at the time of that backup.
