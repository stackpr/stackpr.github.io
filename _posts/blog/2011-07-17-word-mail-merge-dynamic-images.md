I started with <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/mail_merge_graphics.htm">these instructions</a> that attempt to cram all of the work into the template itself. While it may work just fine, it did not work on my first attempt. I went to a slightly more manual approach as described <a href="http://onmerge.com/articleIncludePicture.html">here</a>. Step 10 requires you to select all the new letters and update the image file links. That's it. The formulas can stay a little shorter as long as you are willing to do one quick step at the end of each merge.</p>
