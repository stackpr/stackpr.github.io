The virtual image does not work as well for these purposes as a bare metal installation, especially when running multiple monitors. The primary issue that arises is that vmware has trouble detecting the screen size, which is a necessary step for launching Chromium in full screen. However, if you run on a single monitor, it may serve to support very low-level tests. Of course, if you are serious about running kiosks, it is probably worth installing Lubuntu directly on a test server.</p>
