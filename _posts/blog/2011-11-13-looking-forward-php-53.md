Based on those benchmarks, Drupal with APC&nbsp;should see about 3% improvement (far less than Drupal without APC). After migrating to a completely new AMI with an update to Linux, PHP, Apache, Varnish, etc., I&nbsp;saw nearly 30% improvement with Drupal and APC. Too many systems updated for me to tell which provided the performance boost without major research time.</p>
<p>In addition to the improved speed, I'm looking forward to incorporating closures into future modules. There are some neat libraries out there that require 5.3. I'll report back once I&nbsp;find one that justifies inclusion in my workflow. Until then...</p></div></div></div>  </div>
