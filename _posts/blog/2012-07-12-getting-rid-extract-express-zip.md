Â Apparently, these install-on-demand applications are standard fare with NCH software. However, like many of their users, I want to continue using their software without dealing with the nuisance "features" that come with the software.</p>
<p>It seemed like CCleaner should have been able to address the issue. I love it as a resource, and one of their tools allows you to examine customized context menus. However, these entries did not even appear. After much searching, I stumbled across <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shell_menu_view.html">ShellMenuView</a>. It runs on most versions of Windows, and it allowed me to disable (not delete) the unwanted context menu items.</p>
