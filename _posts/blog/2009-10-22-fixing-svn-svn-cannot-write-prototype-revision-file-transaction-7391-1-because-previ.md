<h2>Solution</h2>
<ol><li>Locate the offending transation (not the one in the error!):<br />
    svnadmin lstxns /path/to/repository<br /><em>Repeat this step several times over a few minutes to ensure that it is actually stuck and not just slow.</em></li>
    <li>Remove the offending transactionÂ (change the id based on the first step):<br />
    svnadmin rmtxns /path/to/repository 6265-1</li>
</ol></div></div></div>  </div>
