We see a 2/3 share for <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/operating_system/all">Linux</a>, <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/web_server/all">Apache</a> and <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language/all">PHP </a>and Linux. Drupal is the 3rd place CMS, but <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all">its market share is growing</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://trends.builtwith.com/cms/Drupal">builtwith.com statistics</a> are an especially nice statistic for Drupal fans out there. Unlike most widespread CMSes, Drupal sees a higher market share with larger web sites. The market share increases from the top-million to top-100,000 to top-10,000 web sites. That is extremely reversed for both Joomla! and Wordpress, meaning that people abandon them as their traffic increases.</p>
<p>Despite the criticism that PHP and Drupal face, they continue to rule the Internet. And Drupal is proving to be one of the most robust and enterprise-ready open source CMSes.</p>
