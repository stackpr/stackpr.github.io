	<p>On this point we differ emphatically with many of our friends and acquaintances who say, in effect, "Never mind how we live today; we are in this dog-eat-dog social system and we may as well get what we can out of it. But tomorrow, in a wiser, more social and more humane world, we live more rationally, more economically, more efficiently, more socially". Such talk is nonsense. As we live in the present, so is our future shaped, channeled and largely determined. (chapter 8, page 184, 1970 reprint)</p>
