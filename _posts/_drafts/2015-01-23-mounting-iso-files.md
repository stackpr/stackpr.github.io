[CloneDrive](http://www.slysoft.com/en/virtual-clonedrive.html) has proven incredibly useful enough times that I want to document it here for my reference. In the new world where many computers lack an optical drive and many installations come on downloadable virtual CDs rather than actual CDs, this handy free app is by far the easiest way to access data via .iso files.

Once installed, you can use the context menu to mount and unmount an iso file. Once mounted, it even triggers an autostart such that it behaves almost exactly like a physical drive. The only difference I've noted is that you should unmount rather than eject to ensure that the file is properly released.
