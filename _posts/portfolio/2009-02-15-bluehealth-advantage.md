<div>
	 </div>
<div>
	Utilizing our standard 4-factor templating techniques allowed for rapid development of this web site. However, the site is driven by content that appears in both individual and employer versions of the site. We perform master page switching to swap styles and web address prefixes.</div>
<div>
	 </div>
<div>
	The expert section provides a multi-author blog system.</div>
<div>
	 </div>
<div>
	The video section is expanding to provide more dynamic content for users.</div>
<div>
	 </div>
<div>
	Overall, the site is highly reliant on creative templates and API-driven adjustments to content. Examples of the improvements include FAQ, resources, search and education.</div>
