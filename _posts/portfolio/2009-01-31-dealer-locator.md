This utilizes a MySql UDF for geocoding, combined with a bias for particular dealer characteristics.Â The combination of filters and technology provides efficient results for finding the ideal local dealer.</p>
<p>The zip code is geocoded to constitute the base location. The zip code is stored with the user to minimize search time on repeated visits. When the zip code is stored, a location block is provided on the home page.</p>
