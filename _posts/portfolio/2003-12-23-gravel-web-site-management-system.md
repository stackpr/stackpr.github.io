During that time, I built it from scratch to handle whatever challenges the aijalon clients brought our way. I did a lot with it, but I did not take any screenshots. Courtesy of the <a href="http://archive.org">Way Back Machine</a>, I have found a few images that hint at what GRAVEL could do.</p>
<p>GRAVEL was started back in 1999 in the days before "CMS" was coined as standard jargon and a foregone conclusion. It broke new ground. While it had many of the same features as modern-day CMS applications (Drupal, Joomla, DotNetNuke, etc), it had a different underlying development framework in terms of integration, storage and customization. This was the largest closed-source project I have worked on. The goal was complete online customizability, so many of the feature silos became quite sophisticated.</p>
<p>The small images of GRAVEL are in orange, which was a rebranding effort that occurred after my departure from aijalon. Unfortunately, it is the best I can do after so many years...</p>
<p>When I left in 2003, the system features included:</p>
<ol><li>
		Membership system</li>
	<li>
		Contact management</li>
	<li>
		Database management</li>
	<li>
		Email form creation (with database integration)</li>
	<li>
		Calendars (with the ability to share events)</li>
	<li>
		Banners</li>
	<li>
		Shopping Cart</li>
	<li>
		Email list management</li>
	<li>
		Photo albums</li>
	<li>
		Quick Polls</li>
</ol><p>I was replaced by two full-time developers. I did not monitor progress on the system after helping to migrate a couple systems into Collaborate. The system went with aijalon as it merged with Pickering Creative Group.</p>
<p>This system was used in roughly 100 sites after its first four years. The lessons I learned building that system were applied to GoRad and Collaborate. It was a great experience, and it set the stage for the impressive projects that came after it.</p>
