To push the site to the next level, we built the RSS Module, an enhanced Drupal theme engine, and a GoRad integration module. The site automatically syncs thousands of articles from EBSCO, a content provider. The screenshots do a reasonable job highlighting the range of features. </p>
<!--break-->
<p>Features you can see in the screenshots:</p>
<ol><li>
		Video/media management that provides text and video for the Flash video player on the home page</li>
	<li>
		Syndicated content from EBSCO is transformed using XSLT and then saved to Drupal nodes</li>
	<li>
		Search result previews are loaded via AJAX as the user types in the search box</li>
	<li>
		Multi-factor find-a-doctor search preserves its filters and allows quick narrowing of results</li>
	<li>
		My Health Portal provides access to content of interest to the user and tracks some important information</li>
	<li>
		Users can join groups for support and discussion in My Health</li>
	<li>
		Users can subscribe to different news channels in My Health</li>
	<li>
		Users can track events in a calendar in My Health</li>
</ol><p>The site is high-quality. Several of these features rely heavily on the GoRad Media Module. That provided a consistent and stable administrative interface. Although there are few new features developed just for this site, it did require quite a bit of polishing. The bulk of the work was customizing the UI experience. Fine details like the search ajax and quick links received a lot of attention. This was a very well-run project.</p>
<p>We worked on two sister sites in 2009, and other vendors also started to work within this system.</p>
