The design is nice, but the distinguishing characteristic of this project is that it was built using <strong>DotNetNuke</strong>.</p>
<p>DotNetNuke has a nice community, which makes it a good solution for a small site that cannot afford license fees or larger systems that require support. Beyond the community, it seems to lack the documentation and usability of other systems that I have used. Even in ASP.Net, I would prefer Ektron or Umbraco.</p>
