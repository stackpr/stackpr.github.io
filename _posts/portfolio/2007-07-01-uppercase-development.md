By providing a unique view of the browsing history through the creative display of the golden rectangle (and the Fibonacci sequence), the target audience was allowed to see a simple example of the creative development provided without appearing to compete in terms of interface design.</p>
<p>With minimal modifications to content and compatibility with new browsers, this web site saw the growth up the firm from 2 employees to a maximum of 9 employees.</p>
<p>The site consisted of only one HTML file and one image file. The rest was contained in JavaScript and CSS. It was maintained in Dreamweaver. Extremely fast to load, and navigation was instantaneous since everything preloaded.</p>
<p><em>Update (2012): Site is offline. Domain name was forfeited and later purchased by an unrelated party.</em></p>
