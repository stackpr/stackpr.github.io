The online sessions are low-cost, especially for members. To keep costs under control during the experimental phase, I created the logo based on a modified logo template from <a href="http://www.templatemonster.com/">Template Monster</a>. The logo includes a simple academic look with CPNP colors and motto.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the metric for CPNP U is the number of sessions that people complete, regardless of the income. It is a method of spreading knowledge.</p>
<p>It only took about a year for the word to get out about CPNP U. After that point, we have seen consistent (and growing) utilization of the online sessions. We will continue to experiment with presentation and promotion, but the online sessions are here to stay.</p>
