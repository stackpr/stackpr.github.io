The designs are hardly spectacular, but they were decent for their time. Here a few notes about these sites:</p>
<ul><li>
		These are my first sites</li>
	<li>
		This was so long ago that I worked on a NeXTCube</li>
	<li>
		This was so long ago that dial-up was standard - sites had to be markup-only</li>
	<li>
		This was so long ago that Netscape was important</li>
</ul><p>Take a look at the screenshots to enjoy the old-school header-only design style.</p>
