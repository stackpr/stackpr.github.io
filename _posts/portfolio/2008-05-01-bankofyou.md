My role in the project was to provide server-side development and ActionScript integration with that code. The application provides a custom low-barrier authentication mechanism to increase participation. Once in the system, an interview with the user provides simple product recommendations. A wonderful addition of functionality provides the ability to find bank and ATM locations based on the person's home, school and work addresses. A powerful and effective tool.</p>
