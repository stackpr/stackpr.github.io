I was building a developer-only company to provide services and/or partnership opportunities to design/marketing firms. With that simple brand of development and not design, I had three objectives in creating our brand resources. First, we needed to look clean and professional. Second, we needed to avoid looking like a design firm. Third, we needed to be able to quickly apply the brand to new media with minimal effort such that a basic set of templates would allow us to focus on content and development without being distracted by design demands that were well outside our skillsets. As with the company name, the focus was on development and not on advanced design.</p>
