Users can upload a photo along with their story, although it is not required.Â In addition to posting content directly to CCK nodes in Drupal, it seeds each node with 30 3-star votes to create a Bayesian average that offsets the bias of only a few voters.</p>
<p>The contest received a substantial number of submissions, exceeding expectations. The winners, selected by a panel of judges after voting, are marked with a small banner icon.</p>
<p>This is a nice little site that takes advantage of the capabilities of the Drupal CMS, while filling in the gaps with a custom module and theme.</p>
