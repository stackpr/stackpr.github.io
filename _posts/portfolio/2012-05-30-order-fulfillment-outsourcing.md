Orders had been fulfilled by staff for a handful of years, predating my coming on board. Unfortunately, the volume peaked each year during the spring, immediately preceding our major annual meeting. The doubling of stress had a draining effect every year. The in-house strategy traded staff time for small amounts of money in three ways: (1) the labor of fulfillment could be outsourced, (2) the packaging could be more labor-friendly for more money, and (3) low postage rates required delivering the products to the post office. With plenty of other organizational initiatives coming about over the preceding years, all constituents were ready to examine alternate fulfillment options.</p>
<p>A national search revealed that there were three tiers of providers. The high-cost providers were ignored immediately, and I assume that they exist by charging a premium to a smaller number of clients. The mid-cost providers are a reasonable alternative. They have cost parity with in-house fulfillment only when you also consider all staff time and trips to the post office. The low-cost providers can actually save money when compared to staff fulfillment, when staff time is considered. We selected from a handful of local providers that had pricing-service combinations that are comparable to national services (staff benefit from feeling better about having resources close by). As we examined things more closely, we discovered that they had the ability to save money on packaging materials and postage such that they experienced less of a money-time trade-off. Combined with their volume of fulfillment operations, we were able to establish a fulfillment arrangement that saved us significant time for a reasonable cost, and they gained another client to grow their services business.</p>
<p>While the cost-benefit analysis would vary significantly by company, a secondary option that was nearly as good was to use priority mail. That would eliminate packaging expense, make packaging quick/easy, and facilitate having someone pick up the packages (not available for low-cost mail options).</p>
<p>The fulfillment was supported by streamlining the shipment tracking system. A spreadsheet is generated quickly online that includes the orders and instructions regarding what insert should be included with the mailing. Five full months later, after the greatest rush of orders, it has proven to be a solid decision.</p>
