I implemented the Dreamweaver templates and the necessary server-side features. The distinctive features of the project were the PDF Form and a Simple HTML Form system.</p>
<p>The PDF Form was created by adding PDF fields to a scanned version of a print form. It then posts to a PHP form handler. The handler validates the field names/order using an MD5 check, and the data is then cleaned and emailed.</p>
<p>The Simple HTML Form configures the form using XHTML. The form handler/processor extracts validation and configurations from the XHTML. As long as users do not change the PHP at the end of the file, they can actually edit the form and validation in Dreamweaver Design View.</p>
