    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>This site built upon the success of the initial <a href="/portfolio/nebraska-foundation-multi-site-framework">multi-site framework</a> and the <a href="http://stories.nufoundation.org">stories</a> site that was built in the summer (by <a href="/team/keiser">Keiser</a>). The bulk of the project was theme-related. The newsletter form submits through a custom PHP proxy script via AJAX, and then the form is hidden. The send-to-a-friend feature integrates with addthis.com using some custom JS that allows us to monitor statistics with other sharing numbers. Google Charts are used to convert user-input data into bar and pie charts.</p>
<p>Blogs and press releases are pulled creatively throughout the site. It pushed the limits of Drupal content structure, but the design was rock solid and implementation was fun. Although there was not a lot of new server-side functionality for this site, I am quite proud of the end result.</p>
