    <div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>This was a large and exciting site conversion project. We moved the site from Coldfusion to Drupal. On top of that, we also had to integrate the site with WeatherbyNation.com, a site that I built a year earlier (also in Drupal). There were dozens of features built into this site, but here are a few distinctive features:</p>
<ol><li>
		Commerce: The site uses an advanced combination of Ubercart modules to achieve the needed functionality</li>
	<li>
		Imports: Stock info and other product information can be imported using an Assistant-based system that uses standard Assistant configuration for both validation and data integration</li>
	<li>
		Menus: The menu layout is very site-specific, and it relies heavily on caching for efficient rendering</li>
	<li>
		Product Landing: Depending on product type, there are several different types of navigation. Rifles, clearance, cartridges and apparel represent four distinct types of products</li>
</ol><p>This was a major project, and the largest systems are separated into separate portfolio pages. I was involved in all system design, and notable portions of the site were delegated entirely to various staff members at Uppercase Development.</p>
