The site framework we built provided a major upgrade to their online services, including the addition of multilingual and regional-based content customization. The size of the site, the complexity of its interfaces, and the timeline for buildout serve as a testiment to the flexibility and power of GoRad and Collaborate even when they were relatively young.</p>
<p>The screenshots of this site were taken after the client re-themed the web site. However, the underlying technologies remain the GoRad framework and the Collaborate CMS (rebranded "Post CMS").</p>
<!--break-->
<p>In addition to the large size of the site, specific features of note include:</p>
<ol><li>Site index and searching</li>
    <li>Dynamic (JS) hierarchical lists built using the sitemap admin interface</li>
    <li>Multi-lingual support</li>
    <li>Multi-region support (select a country)</li>
    <li>Landing pages built dynamically from relevant pages</li>
    <li>Dealer password-protected areas</li>
    <li>Contact forms</li>
</ol><p>This site is a premium example of what Collaborate could do even in its young form, and the relatively short timeline for delivery was a testiment to the flexibility of the GoRad framework.</p></div></div></div>  </div>
