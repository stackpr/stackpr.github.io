The development consisted of a server-side handler for accepting a movie submission, storing on S3, and uploading to YouTube. The secondary development was providing the necessary ActionScript classes/methods to handle the submission.</p>
<p>The client was able to integrate the ActionScript examples into their Flash application. The end result was an attractive site with intensive functionality. It is hard to show the portion of the development IÂ provided, but the key point is that I was able to provide the necessary functionality without impacting the design at all.</p>
