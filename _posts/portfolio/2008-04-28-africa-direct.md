They have been building their system for quite a few years, and it is designed to handle inventory, online shopping, Amazon inventory management, eBay store management, discount tracking, reporting, and more. We were able to successfully implement a number of new features. The lack of a double-entry ledger system was creating limits for the reporting capabilities, but it was still an extremely powerful system.</p>
<p>The system was partially migrated into the Zend Framework system for MVC, and it leveraged a portion of the GoRad toolkit.</p>
<p>They have a great selection of products and an excellent customer service record.</p>
