While there are several techniques for multi-site implementations, they did not address the key project requirements:</p>
<ol><li>
		Nodes can exist on multiple sites</li>
	<li>
		Each site can point an alias to different nodes</li>
	<li>
		Search results should only return nodes from a particular site</li>
	<li>
		Online site creation with zero ssh login</li>
	<li>
		Easy color/style control per "site" (host/domain collection)</li>
</ol><p>The system was built in Drupal 5. In my opinion, Drupal 6 was not ready until late August, several months after rollout. There was a node_access modules that related to multi-site implementations that was used as a rough template. In the end, taxonomy was used for ultimate control.</p>
<p>My role on the project shifted over time. At times, I was a developer. At times, I simply reviewed the plans/implementation of Helzer/Nathan. I wound up rolling the project live March 31, the day before I started at CPNP. I supported it in the evenings for several months. In a way, it was the final Uppercase Development project. Given that my first effort at CPNP was a conversion to Drupal, it seems like all roads do lead to Rome...</p>
<p>The system works fine. Keiser independently expanded the functionality later in the summer. I eventually do some additional work. Check later portfolio entries for more advanced interfaces that utilize this framework.</p>
