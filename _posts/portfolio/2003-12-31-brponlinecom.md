There were both Flash and JavaScript versions of the site (JS is pictured) that looked and functioned nearly identically.</p>
<p>This was my first major project providing web service access to Flash and AJAX. In addition to the Flash/ActionScript support on the project, this also provides a sophisticated DHTML interface using a custom JavaScript interface library. This predates jQuery/Prototype/etc, and AJAX was in its infancy.</p>
<p>The four screenshots:</p>

		Products in a collection: Loaded via AJAX, and product list scrolls dynamically</li>

		Products filtered by type</li>

		Print selection (to build your own catalog)</li>
	<li>
		Print version</li>
